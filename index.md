Interested in advanced algorithms within the realm of AI and underlying techstack that powers them. I use this space to share my notes and projects. The notes are usually an attempt for me to better understand a concept introduced in a research paper. The projects are my implementation of things I find interesting.

Algorithms interested in:
- JEPA
- Selective Activation/Computation: Ideas behind CoT, ToT, MoE, and so on.
- Flow Matching

Backend stack
- Custom Kernel writing
- Inference platforms/tools: Tiny, Modular (Mojo, Max platform), companies like Groq, Cerebras Systems
- Airflow, Kafka, DynaTrace
