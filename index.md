I am deeply interested in data flows and their critical role in powering advanced analytics and machine learning models. The seamless movement and transformation of data through pipelines excite me because they enable the creation of intelligent systems that can learn, adapt, and generate predictive insights. I am particularly enthusiastic about the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), as these technologies represent the forefront of innovationâ€”allowing machines to learn from data patterns, automate complex tasks, and continuously improve through experience. Exploring how AI and ML integrate with data engineering to build scalable, efficient, and explainable models is a passion that drives my curiosity and professional growth.
